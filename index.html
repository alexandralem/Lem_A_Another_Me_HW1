			I am from Kazakhstan. It's a wonderful country located just below Russia. I live in Nur-Sultan, the capital, which is famous for its extreme continential climate with the temperature in winter occasionally reaching -30Â°C. Nur-Sultan is a new, rapidly developing city which lies right in the heart of Kazakhstan's steppes.
